Machine Learning final project:
The task is content-based music genre classification: given only a song's audio
content predict how likely the genre label matches the song.

To evaluate performance,
your predictions will be used to rank order a test set of
songs according to each of 147 genres. We then compute the Area Under the ROC Curve score
for each genre ranking and average them together to get the Mean Columnwise Area Under the ROC Curve (MCAUC).
